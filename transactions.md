More info

Check out our trading walkthru for more information

**Called contract:** `ProxyERC20`

**Target \(underlying\) contract:** `PeriFinance`

**Methods:**

* `exchange(bytes32 src, uint256 fromAmount, bytes32 dest)`
* `exchangeOnBehalf(address user, bytes32 src, uint256 fromAmount, bytes32 dest)`

**Events Emitted:**

On a successful transaction, the following events occur:

#### Fee Reclamation 

If fees are owing on the `src` pynth, these events come first:

1. `Transfer` from `account` to `0x0` for `feesOwing` emitted on `Proxy<pynth>` for the `src` pynth.
2. `Burned` `feesOwing` from `account` emitted on `Proxy<pynth>` for the `src` pynth.
3. `ExchangeReclaim` from `account` for `feesOwing` on `src` synth emitted on `ProxySynthetix`

Else if fees are owed on the `src` pynth, then these events come first:

1. `Transfer` from `0x0` to `account` for `feesOwed` emitted on `Proxy<pynth>` for the `src` pynth.
2. `Issued` `feesOwed` to `account` emitted on `Proxy<synth>` for the `src` synth.
3. `ExchangeRebate` from `account` for `feesOwed` on `src` pynth emitted on `ProxySynthetix`

For every exchange, the following events then occur:

1. `Transfer` from `account` to `0x0` for `fromAmount` emitted on `Proxy<pynth>` for the `src` pynth.
2. `Burned` `fromAmount` from `account` emitted on `Proxy<pynth>` for the `src` pynth.
3. `Transfer` from `0x0` to `account` for `toAmount - fee` emitted on on `Proxy<pynth>` for the `dest` pynth.
4. `Issued` `toAmount - fee` to `account` emitted on `Proxy<pynth>` for the `dest` pynth.
5. `Transfer` from `0x0` to `FEE_ADDRESS` for `fee` emitted on `ProxypUSD`
6. `Issued` `amount` to `FEE_ADDRESS` emitted on `ProxypUSD`
7. `PynthExchange` for `account` emitted on `ProxySynthetix`
