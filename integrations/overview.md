#### Address Resolver[Â¶](https://docs.synthetix.io/integrations/#address-resolver) <a id="address-resolver"></a>

In our Polygon release, we introduced a new feature called the Address Resolver contract.

In short, the Address Resolver allows any referencing contract to have access to a number of key contract - in particular the underlying PeriFinance, FeePool, PynthUSD contracts. 

We have one for each testnet and mainnet up on the addresses page. For guides on how to use the AddressResolver in Solidity, see our Staking section.
