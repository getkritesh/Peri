Getting help with testnets

If you notice anything wrong with the testnets, please ask in the `#dev-portal` channel of our Discord.

The PeriFinance protocol is available on the following testnets:

1. `kovan`
2. `kovan-ovm`

All of the latest addresses can be found via our addresses section.

We strive to ensure our testing environments is as close as possible to mainnet. All testnets use both the centralized PeriFinance oracle and decentralized Chainlink aggregators. These oracles are supplied with testnet ETH and run consistently.

You can use the `PeriFinance` npm module with the `network` above to get targets \(addresses\), sources \(ABIs\) and pynths.

In the interests of dogfooding our own tools, if you require testnet PERI or pUSD, please use our `Depot` contract.

For `kovan` it's https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x71afb1b2A9AD48B42D190A844F2eD27B150B496b

To get testnet `ETH`, search for your friendly testnet faucet.
