# Governance

The Peri Finance Protocol has several key governing bodies and artifacts which co-exist to enable the decentralised nature of the Protocol. The key decentralised autonomous organisations \(DAOs\) are the - Spartan Council, Protocol DAO, Peri Finance DAO, Ambassadors DAO and the Grants DAO.

The Peri Finance decentralised governance process utilises these key artifacts - Peri Finance Improvement Proposals \(PIPs\) and the Peri Finance Configuration Change Proposals \(PCCPs\) which effectively outline proposed present, past and future changes to the Peri Finance Protocol.
