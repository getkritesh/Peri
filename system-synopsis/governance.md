# Governance

The Peri Finance Protocol has several key governing bodies and artifacts which co-exist to enable the decentralized nature of the Protocol. The key decentralized autonomous organizations \(DAOs\) are the - Spartan Council, Protocol DAO, Peri Finance DAO, Ambassadors DAO and the Grants DAO.

The Peri Finance decentralized governance process utilizes these key artifacts - Peri Finance Improvement Proposals \(PIPs\) and the Peri Finance Configuration Change Proposals \(PCCPs\) which effectively outline proposed present, past and future changes to the Peri Finance Protocol.

## A**rtifacts**

### Peri Finance Improvement Proposals \(PIPs\)

The PIP is an artifact used to describe proposed changes to the core Peri Finance Protocol. They can be authored by anyone and feature the motivation, technical specifications and rationale behind design decisions relating to the proposed idea.

PIPs are used as an artifact by the Spartan Council who is responsible for conducting interviews with the PIP author and debating on the implications of the PIP within the council chamber and also by the protocol DAO who is responsible for implementing the technical changes on the discretion of the Spartan Council.

Although anyone can author a PIP, it is ultimately up to the Spartan Council to approve and accept a PIP, all successful PIPs are granted a Peri Finance Network Token reward.

## Peri Finance Configuration Change Proposal \(PCCPs\)

The PCCP is an artifact which follows the same authoring and review process as the PIP, except the contents of the PCCP contain proposed changes to existing parameters of the system. As a result of this, PCCPs commonly reference a PIP that is deployed on the Peri Finance Protocol.
