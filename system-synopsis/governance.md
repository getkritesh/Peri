# Voting and Governance

The Peri Finance Protocol has several key governing bodies and artifacts which co-exist to enable the decentralized nature of the Protocol. The key decentralized autonomous organizations \(DAOs\) are the - Spartan Council, Protocol DAO, Peri Finance DAO, Ambassadors DAO and the Grants DAO.

The Peri Finance decentralized governance process utilizes these key artifacts - Peri Finance Improvement Proposals \(PIPs\) and the Peri Finance Configuration Change Proposals \(PCCPs\) which effectively outline proposed present, past and future changes to the Peri Finance Protocol.

## A**rtifacts**

### Peri Finance Improvement Proposals \(PIPs\)

The PIP is an artifact used to describe proposed changes to the core Peri Finance Protocol. They can be authored by anyone and feature the motivation, technical specifications and rationale behind design decisions relating to the proposed idea.

PIPs are used as an artifact by the Spartan Council who is responsible for conducting interviews with the PIP author and debating on the implications of the PIP within the council chamber and also by the protocol DAO who is responsible for implementing the technical changes on the discretion of the Spartan Council.

Although anyone can author a PIP, it is ultimately up to the Spartan Council to approve and accept a PIP, all successful PIPs are granted a Peri Finance Network Token reward.

## Peri Finance Configuration Change Proposal \(PCCPs\)

The PCCP is an artifact which follows the same authoring and review process as the PIP, except the contents of the PCCP contain proposed changes to existing parameters of the system. As a result of this, PCCPs commonly reference a PIP that is deployed on the Peri Finance Protocol.

## Decentralised Autonomous Organisations

#### Spartan Council \(SC\) <a id="spartan-council-sc"></a>

The Spartan Council \(SC\) is a governing DAO which currently comprises 8 members who are elected \(see Elections\) for the duration of an epoch by community staking participants. SC is responsible for conducting PIP/PCCP interviews, debating the implications of proposed changes, coordinating protocol changes with the protocol DAO and hosting periodic community governance meetings in order to best represent and protect the wider Peri Finance stakeholders.

The SC, like other DAO roles, are paid a stipend by the Peri Finance DAO and conduct their duties on the relevant discord governance channels and utilises snapshot’s IPFS signature voting on the staking governance site.

#### Protocol DAO \(pDAO\) <a id="protocol-dao-pdao"></a>

The Protocol DAO \(pDAO\) is the DAO is an organisation which operates out of a Gnosis multi-signature wallet. The wallet is assigned as the owner of the Peri Finance Protocol core contracts, which makes the pDAO responsible for upgrading and releasing new contracts on behalf of the Spartan Council.

Members of the pDAO are appointed to be signers of the Gnosis multi-sig by the Spartan Council, who use a strict criteria to identify who is eligible to become a pDAO member.

#### Peri Finance DAO \(pDAO\) <a id="synthetix-dao-sdao"></a>

The Peri Finance DAO is the DAO responsible for managing the Peri Finance Protocol treasury, their only role is ensuring that the Peri Finance governing bodies remain incentivised to support the Peri Finance Ecosystem’s upkeep and future development.

#### Ambassador DAO \(aDAO\) <a id="ambassador-dao-adao"></a>

Ambassadors are nominated community members who are appointed as a signer on a Gnosis multisig, their role is to gather support from Peri Finance community members who delegate their governance tokens \(from other external protocols\) to the multisig, effectively empowering the Ambassadors to participate in external protocols governance systems which have a positive impact on the Peri Finance ecosystem \(i.e interoperable protocol features, listing of Peri Finance pynths on DEX’s\).

The Ambassadors are re-elected every epoch, and the members are paid a stipend by the pDAO during their tenure.

#### Grants DAO \(gDAO\) <a id="grants-dao-gdao"></a>

The grantsDAO is the organisation that is responsible for vetting, issuing and accepting proposals to be funded. The proposals consist of public goods that community members want to be built that directly benefit the Peri Finance ecosystem.

With their budget, the gDAO also funds public hackathons and external developments in which the core contributors might consider out of their scope.

They operate out of a Gnosis multisig and are paid a stipend by the pDAO.

#### Core Contributors <a id="core-contributors"></a>

A decentralised cluster of autonomous teams that are paid a stipend by the pDAO and support the Peri Finance Protocol via a variety of development and non-developmental roles \(i.e marketing, design, development etc\).

### Ceremonies <a id="ceremonies"></a>

#### Elections <a id="elections"></a>

An integral part of the Peri Finance Governance Process is the DAO election process. To prevent a stagnant governance system, the different DAO’s have specific epochs in which the members operate within.

At the end of each epoch, the community conducts an election via snapshot’s IPFS infrastructure where the participants staking to the Peri Finance Protocol are assigned a weighted-vote in which they can delegate to the member they’d like to see on the DAO.

#### Community Governance Call <a id="community-governance-call"></a>

Once a month, the DAO’s collectively host a community call on discord which is a public forum in which the DAO’s give an overview of their work and provide an open-environment for community members to express their opinions to the governing bodies directly.

#### PIP/PCCP interviews <a id="sipsccp-interviews"></a>

As a part of the Spartan Council role, interviews are conducted between the PIP/PCCP authors and the Spartan Council in order to discuss the implications and design choices of a proposed change to the Peri Finance Protocol. The public nature of these interviews provides a transparent way for the community members to understand the changes being proposed and also safeguards the system through having more accountability within the decision making process.
