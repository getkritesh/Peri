# Incentives

Here is an overview of the incentives and token flow in the Peri Finance system. It is built around incentives; users who benefit from a service pay other users who enable that service. This section will explain each category of rewards as well as each acting party within the system.

## Sources of Value

#### PERI Staking Rewards <a id="snx-staking-rewards"></a>

PERI holders will receive three different rewards by staking PERI.

The first reward comes from PERI inflationary supply policy. PERI staking rewards are generated through the inflationary monetary policy implemented. Stakers can claim their staking rewards, which are escrowed for a year. 52 weeks After , Peri staking rewards start, inflation amounts decrease weekly by 1.25%. 

After 40 months, the annual inflation rate will be fixed at 5%. 80% of the inflation reward will go to users who staked PERI and the rest to users staking USDC or DAI, which can be changed by PERIDAO community in the future

The second reward is the distribution of PERI.Assets' revenue. The managed funds come from 50% of the fund raised by PERI token sales, so the holders can be rewarded additional profits only by staking PERI. The profit only goes in proportion to those who maintain C-Ratio \(collaterization ratio\) above 400% during the rewards claiming period with PERI \(50%\) and BTC/ETH \(50%\).

Finally, the distribution of commissions incurred in Pynths transactions and leveraged Pynths contract trading.

### Secondary incentives <a id="secondary-incentives"></a>

In addition to the two primary forms of incentives, Peri Finance also runs various incentives to create on-ramps, balance out particular dynamics, or trial different behavior. These are either paid with a portion of the weekly inflationary PERI when implemented at the protocol level, or with PERI from the PeroiDAO treasury if they are just trials.

## Value Recipients

## PERI Stakers

PERI stakers stake their PERI and receive three kinds of rewards. But by staking, they also take on the risk of 'debt.' When someone stakes their PERI, to then immediately unstake it they need to burn as much pUSD as they just minted â€” this pUSD figure is their debt, and all PERI stakers' debt is pooled together \(with each staker holding a proportion of it\). But this pooled debt is also where profits and losses from people trading on PERI.Exchange is represented, so a staker's debt can change over time depending on traders' overall profits and losses. This is the risk they assume when staking their PERI.

### USDC stakers

It is also possible to mint Pynths by staking USDC. However, USDC stakers' debt is denominated in pUSD. It does not get added to the system's pooled debt, and thus does not fluctuate depending on traders' outcomes.The ratio of PERI to USDC will be 8:2, which can be changed by PERI DAO later

#### Traders <a id="traders"></a>

Traders on Peri.Exch ange can take advantage of the system enabled by PERI stakers, namely trading a wide variety of assets with infinite liquidity and no slippage. They do not need to stake or even hold PERI.

#### Arbitrageurs <a id="arbitrageurs"></a>

The primary opportunity for arbitrage in PERI Synthetic is taking advantage of underpriced assets on the secondary market. If pUSD are ever trading below the price of USD respectively, then stakers can profit by purchasing them cheaply and using them within the Peri Finance System, where their values do not take the market rate into consideration.
