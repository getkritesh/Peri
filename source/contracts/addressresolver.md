# AddressResolver

### Description <a id="description"></a>

This contract is a type of Service Locator pattern that allows for easier interaction between multiple contracts. Instead of contract A needing references to contracts B and C \(and updating every release\), contract A can refer to an `AddressResolver` and query for B and C at transaction time. Then, during a release, the AddressResolver is updated with the latest B and C contract. Thus this ensures that contract A always has the latest B and C contracts.
